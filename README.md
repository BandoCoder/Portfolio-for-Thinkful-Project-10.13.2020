## Bio

From the time I first learned to use the dev tools inside chrome, I couldn't stop looking at code. From interactive web apps to your web store, my goal is to make your vision come true. I am a full-stack developer with experience in other technical fields that help me design what you need. Researching new technologies is something I use to advance my skills as a developer while keeping up to date with industry standards. A creative approach to problem-solving is something I have developed to ensure professional productivity remains my top priority.

Aside from coding, I enjoy spending quality time with my family. As a musician, I enjoy writing music and practicing my sound design on various personal projects. We are full-time RVers who like to travel and experience new places on a deep level.
